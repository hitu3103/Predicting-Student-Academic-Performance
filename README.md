📊 Student Performance Analysis Using Exploratory Data Analytics
🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding how various socio-demographic and educational factors influence students' academic performance. Using the popular Students Performance in Exams dataset, we explore relationships between:

Gender

Ethnicity

Parental Level of Education

Lunch (Standard / Free-Reduced)

Test Preparation Course (Completed / None)

and their scores in Mathematics, Reading, and Writing.

The goal is to identify meaningful performance patterns that can help educators design better interventions and support mechanisms.

🧠 Key Objectives

Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis

Visualize score distributions and correlations

Identify how different social factors impact academic outcomes

Provide clear insights through charts and statistical summaries
